# Deciphering Baby Cries: A Deep Learning Approach for Infant Need Classification

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook implementation of a deep learning model for classifying infant needs based on their cries. This project was presented at the 4th BÄ°LSEL International SUMELA Scientific Research Congress in Trabzon, Turkey. 

**Key Features:**

* **Deep Learning:** Advanced techniques for accurate classification.
* **Infant Need Classification:** Identifying needs like hunger, pain, or tiredness.
* **Audio Analysis:** Processing and analyzing infant cry audio signals.

**To Run the Notebook:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your_username/your_repo_name]
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
3. **Run the notebook:** Open Infant_**Baby Crying Classification.ipynb** in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
